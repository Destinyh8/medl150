HW #2: "In Plato's Cave" Chapter 1 Response<br />
From reading Susan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave” from her book titled “On Photography” it’s 
      clear to see that the main idea of this reading is on how photographs influence our perception of reality, 
      photographs also molds our understanding of the world and how we view it. Sontag expresses that photographs 
      are as modern day shadows which are similar to Plato’s cave shadows. Sontag questions the ethical and societal 
      implications of our obsession with images. She says that relying solely on photographs can lead to people 
      detaching from authentic experiences. Sontag also discusses how photographs can be used to manipulate, document 
      or push certain narratives.

On page 22 it says “photographs are valued because they give information.” When reading this it made me think about my experiences especially since I am very visual. I thought about the point Sontag was making and I do agree that photographs are of value due to the information it can carry; this includes information on the past, present and even the future. In educational institutions we see the history and legacy left behind and the achievements of those before us, simply by a dated photograph. Manipulation can come into play because one can distort the truth with a photograph in order to push a different narrative. An example of this is when certain textbooks with photos of historical moments are watered down in order to suppress what actually took place. 
      
  In order to visually represent our world I would portray a scenario where people are surrounded by different images or videos, similar to a museum, and distort what is real. I would portray the individuals to have different expressions of confusion and detachment in order to highlight how photographs and the media shapes our perception of reality. This experiment reflects Sontag’s idea that our society is heavily influenced through visual media, and this can pull us from authentic experiences. Digging deeper into the meaning of what we see through photographs and the media is key to understanding the world around us.
      
On page five it reads “Photographs furnish evidence. Something we hear about but doubt, seems proven when we’re shown a photograph of it.” This statement caught my attention especially when I think about how some may operate today. My friends and I jokingly say “If I didn’t get a picture in it, then it doesn’t count,” so then we repeat the outfit for another event and capture the moment with a picture as there was no evidence of us wearing it previously. Social media and the images we see can distort reality because not everything is what it seems. There are plenty of instances where photographs get distorted, videos and digital images are edited to appear a certain way and this can fool people into believing what they see. It is important to dig deeper in order to pull out the truth from the content we take in. Sontag argues that our constant exposure to photographs can desensitize us and can pull us away from authentic experiences.
      
This definitely relates to our current society where social media and digital images take over our lives, which can often create a distorted view of reality. Sontag pushes for readers to think about how photography influences our moral understanding for readers to approach visual media mindfully in order to see the reality and true meaning behind it. Overall “In Plato’s Cave” serves as a reminder to question the images we take in and to look for a deeper and more authentic understanding of the media and the world around us.
