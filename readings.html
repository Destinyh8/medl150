    <h1>Reading Reflection 1: "In Plato's Cave"</h1>
<h3>HW #2: “In Plato’s Cave” Chapter 1 Response</h3>
<p>From reading Susan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave” from her book titled “On Photography” it’s clear to see that the main idea of this reading is on how photographs influence our perception of reality, photographs also molds our understanding of the world and how we view it. Sontag expresses that photographs are as modern day shadows which are similar to Plato’s cave shadows. Sontag questions the ethical and societal implications of our obsession with images. She says that relying solely on photographs can lead to people detaching from authentic experiences. Sontag also discusses how photographs can be used to manipulate, document or push certain narratives. 
      
On page 22 it says “photographs are valued because they give information.” When reading this it made me think about my experiences especially since I am very visual. I thought about the point Sontag was making and I do agree that photographs are of value due to the information it can carry; this includes information on the past, present and even the future. In educational institutions we see the history and legacy left behind and the achievements of those before us, simply by a dated photograph. Manipulation can come into play because one can distort the truth with a photograph in order to push a different narrative. An example of this is when certain textbooks with photos of historical moments are watered down in order to suppress what actually took place.</p>
      
<p>In order to visually represent our world I would portray a scenario where people are surrounded by different images or videos, similar to a museum, and distort what is real. I would portray the individuals to have different expressions of confusion and detachment in order to highlight how photographs and the media shapes our perception of reality. This experiment reflects Sontag’s idea that our society is heavily influenced through visual media, and this can pull us from authentic experiences. Digging deeper into the meaning of what we see through photographs and the media is key to understanding the world around us.</p>
      
On page five it reads “Photographs furnish evidence. Something we hear about but doubt, seems proven when we’re shown a photograph of it.” This statement caught my attention especially when I think about how some may operate today. My friends and I jokingly say “If I didn’t get a picture in it, then it doesn’t count,” so then we repeat the outfit for another event and capture the moment with a picture as there was no evidence of us wearing it previously. Social media and the images we see can distort reality because not everything is what it seems. There are plenty of instances where photographs get distorted, videos and digital images are edited to appear a certain way and this can fool people into believing what they see. It is important to dig deeper in order to pull out the truth from the content we take in. Sontag argues that our constant exposure to photographs can desensitize us and can pull us away from authentic experiences.
      
This definitely relates to our current society where social media and digital images take over our lives, which can often create a distorted view of reality. Sontag pushes for readers to think about how photography influences our moral understanding for readers to approach visual media mindfully in order to see the reality and true meaning behind it. Overall “In Plato’s Cave” serves as a reminder to question the images we take in and to look for a deeper and more authentic understanding of the media and the world around us.

    <h1>Reading Reflection 2: "With AI slop distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster"</h1>
  <h3> HW #3: "With AI slop distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster" Response</h3>
 <p>    From reading Nesrine Malik’s article titled “With AI slop distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,” I understand that the main idea is AI slop and its negative effects on society. AI slop is a term used for low quality AI generated content which includes images, videos and text. This type of content is created with little human input and it's often inaccurate. This content is contributing to the disorientation of society as it becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish what is real and what is generated by artificial intelligence.</p> 
   Malik argues that this is causing a “new way of sleepwalking into disaster. Not through lack of knowledge, but through the paralysis caused by every event being filtered through this perverse ecosystem.” I paused when I read this because I interact with AI slop as I’m on social media platforms. Sometimes the videos on Instagram or X look so real that I watch the same video a second or third time, just to distinguish whether it's real or not. This content also harms artists and creators by crowding and pushing out their work; which leads to financial losses.</p>
   Malik brings up examples of AI slop on the internet as she mentions AI renderings of JD Vance as a giant baby or even the constant stream of cutesy studio apartments, which Facebook has pushed down her feed. Malik says “And the rapid mutation of the algorithm then feeds users more and more of what it has harvested and deemed interesting to them. The result is that all media consumption, even for the most discerning users, becomes impossible to curate. You are immersed deeper and deeper into subjective worlds rather than objective reality. The result is a very weird disjuncture.” This grabbed my attention as it made me question who’s really in control in regards to media, social media specifically.</p>
   The purpose of Malik’s article is to inform her readers on AI slop and how its constant push on our feeds have a negative impact on our perception. AI slop’s constant presence promotes misinformation and it degrades the quality of content. It diminishes the value of original work created by humans. AI slops internet overload and lack of authenticity can create confusion and distrust in online content. AI generated content is usually created for algorithms rather than for genuine engagement; this leads to clickbait.</p>
    AI generated works often look convincing yet it lacks depth and spreads false information. AI is also based on preconceived notions and stereotypes which can be easily seen and interpreted as inappropriate. All of these factors can lead to the creation of a distorted perception of reality and hinders informed decision making. I’ve had friends and classmates tell me about how their grandparents or their parents would see a video or photo posted and believed it to be true when it was in fact AI generated. As AI progresses it has become more convincing so it’s important to learn and recognize the differences between AI and reality.
